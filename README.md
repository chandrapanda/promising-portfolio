# promising-portfolio

## About the Project
This portfolio showcases my skills as an employee and a developer. Users can view my work and find contact information by clicking links on my page. 

## Highlights
Users can visit github links to a password generator that I created, as well as a JavaScript quiz game. Both projects are interactive and can serve as great examples of what I've learned so far in coding.

## Special Functions
* The page will collapse when used on a smaller screen using a media query. 
* Images are embedded under links to aforementioned projects. 
* Alternative tags for images are placed for screen readers.
